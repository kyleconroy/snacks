Snacks is a stupidly simple and hackable question-and-answer site. 
By simple I mean the Gemfile requires about half a dozen gems, no javascript libraries are used
other than Bootstrap + jQuery, the total application code is < 300 LoC, and there are no runtime dependencies other than Postgres. 

It is meant to be deployed on Heroku and used with Google Apps openid authentication, such as within a company.

Keeping the design snack-like

Referential integrity is good, please use foreign key constraints.
There are no plans to run Snacks on anything other than Postgres.
